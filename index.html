  <h1>Stand Up</h1>
  <p>I been walkin' <br> With my face turned to the sun <br> Weight on my shoulders <br> A bullet in my gun <br> Oh, I got eyes in the back of my head <br> Just in case I have to run <br> I do what I can when I can while I can for my people <br> While the clouds roll back and the stars fill the night <br> That's when I'm gonna stand up <br> Take my people with me <br> Together we are going <br> To a brand new home <br> Far across the river <br> Can you hear freedom calling? <br> Calling me to answer <br> Gonna keep on keepin' on <br> I can feel it in my bones <br> Early in the mornin' <br> Before the sun begins to shine <br> We're gonna start movin' <br> Towards that separating line <br> I'm wadin' through muddy waters <br> You know I got a made up mind <br> And I don't mind if I lose any blood on the way to salvation <br> And I'll fight with the strength that I got until I die <br> So I'm gonna stand up <br> Take my people with me <br> Together we are going <br> To a brand new home <br> Far across the river <br> Can you hear freedom calling? <br> Calling me to answer <br> Gonna keep on keepin' on <br> And I know what's around the bend <br> Might be hard to face 'cause I'm alone <br> And I just might fail <br> But Lord knows I tried <br> Sure as stars fill up the sky <br> Stand up <br> Take my people with me <br> Together we are going <br> To a brand new home <br> Far across the river <br> Can you hear freedom calling? <br> Calling me to answer <br> Gonna keep on keepin' on <br> I'm gonna stand up <br> Take my people with me <br> Together we are going <br> To a brand new home <br> Far across the river <br> Do you hear freedom calling? <br> Calling me to answer <br> Gonna keep on keepin' on <br> I'm gonna stand up <br> Take my people with me <br> Together we are going <br> To a brand new home <br> Far across the river <br> I hear freedom calling <br> Calling me to answer <br> Gonna keep on keepin' on <br> I can feel it in my bones <br> I go to prepare a place for you <br> I go to prepare a place for you <br> I go to prepare a place for you <br> I go to prepare a place for you
